					<span style="font-weight:bold">OUR PROGRAMME</span>
					<p> We introduced indoor training sessions following the huge growth of the <a href="leyton-beach.html"
							style="color:#0018ee;font-weight:bold">SideOut Junior Beach Programme</a> in the summer of 2021, in order to allow our younger members to continue to train, play, compete and develop their skills throughout the winter months. 
					</p>

					<p> Like our Junior Beach Programme, these sessions are managed and delivered by a highly
						experienced team of
						coaches and our goal is to combine fun with top quality training and playing opportunities in a
						friendly
						and safe environment where our young athletes can make new friends, improve their fitness,
						develop their
						skills and - should they eventually choose to - pursue opportunities to compete at local,
						national or even international
						level!</p>

					<span style="font-weight:bold">VOLLEYBALL vs BEACH VOLLEYBALL</span>
					<p> Apart from the obvious difference – beach volleyball is played on sand, while indoor volleyball
						is played on a hard surface – there are also several other differences between the 2 incredibly
						popular Olympic sports, including court size, team sizes, scoring and tactics. However, they
						also
						have many similarities and we strongly believe that the skillsets required in each discipline
						are
						complementary to each other and that young athletes can benefit greatly from getting quality
						coaching in both volleyball and beach volleyball. </p>

					<p> A good case in point is our partner volleyball club, Polonia SideOut London. The team is coached
						by our very own Mark Kontopoulos and they are not only the current National Champions in indoor
						volleyball, but they also feature 6 players who are ranked in the top 8 <span
							style="font-style:italic">beach</span> volleyball teams
						in the UK, including the 2020 and 2021 National Champions! </p>

					<span style="font-weight:bold">THE SESSIONS</span>
					<p>All indoor volleyball activities take place at <span style="font-weight:bold">Pastures Youth
							Centre, 15 Davies Lane, Leytonstone, E11 3DR</span> between October and March each year.
					</p>
					<p>Check out our
						<a href="../calendar-leyton.html" style="color:#0018ee;font-weight:bold">Events
