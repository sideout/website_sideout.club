                                a&nbsp;highly experienced coach and event organiser. With his keen eye for detail and
                                strong &lsquo;can-do&rsquo; attitude, Alex is responsible for all of SideOut&rsquo;s

                                style="font-weight:bold;">Vincennes Volleyball Club</span>, with whom he reached the
                            Cadet and Junior National Cup Finals on 2 occasions, before moving on to the clubs of <span
                                style="font-weight:bold;">Asniers</span> and <span style="font-weight:bold;">Plessis
                                Robinson </span>where he continued to grow and thrive as a junior player with a
                            career-best 3rd place finish in the Junior National Cup Finals. He then returned to
                            Vincennes V.C. to begin his senior career and led the team to promotion from National
                            Division 2 to National Division 1 in 2000.&nbsp;

                                Docklands </span>before transferring to <span style="font-weight:bold;">Polonia London
                                Volleyball Club</span> in 2010. At Polonia, he joined forces with coach Vangelis
                            Koutouleas and made an immediate impact as the team&rsquo;s starting setter. In Alex&rsquo;s
                            first season with Polonia, the team won the 2011 Super 8 Championships &ndash; their first
                            National League title in 26 years. The following season, under the guidance of another
                            SideOut coach, Babis Mamas, Alex helped lead the team to the finals of both the Super 8 and
                            the National Cup. In 2012 Alex was reunited with Vangelis as he transferred to <span
                                style="font-weight:bold;">Wessex VC </span>and became the team&rsquo;s starting setter,
                            playing a vital role in leading them to National League and National Cup glory in April
