                        <p class="font_8">Gabi has consistently ranked amongst the top volleyball and beach volleyball
                            players in the UK in recent years. She has also used her excellent coaching skills as well
                            as her organisational and administrative skills to make a massive contribution to SideOut’s
                            growth since the day it was founded.

                        <p class="font_8">Gabi started her playing career at the age of 14 in her hometown of Jihlava in
                            the Czech Republic with the club <strong>SK Modeta</strong>. Four years later she moved to
                            Berlin, Germany and played for <strong>TSV Tempelhof - Mariendorf</strong> in the 3rd
