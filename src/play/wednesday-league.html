						<p>
							SideOut is proud to present the brand new <span style="font-weight:bold;">Coast Café Wednesday League</span>, taking place at SideOut Beach in Worthing. A different way to enjoy some games and compete in a friendly environment!
						</p>
						<p>
							Starting on the 6th of April and running until the end of September 2022, the Coast Café Wednesday League will offer different formats every month throughout the season. 
						</p>
						<p> <span style="font-weight:bold;">April:</span>  Mixed 2s<br>
							<span style="font-weight:bold;">May:</span>  Men’s 2s<br>
							<span style="font-weight:bold;">June:</span>  Women’s 2s<br>
							<span style="font-weight:bold;">July:</span>  Junior 2s<br>
							<span style="font-weight:bold;">August:</span>  Mixed 4s<br>
							<span style="font-weight:bold;">September:</span>  Junior 4s
						</p>

							<p>
								A maximum of 8 teams will be able to enter each monthly league. Games will be played <span style="font-weight:bold;">every 
									Wednesday between 6pm and 10pm</span> at SideOut Beach in Worthing, with each team playing 2 games per evening capped off by playoff 
									matches to determine the final ranking on the final day of each league!
							</p>


						<h6 style="font-size:16px;font-weight:bold;">
							FORMAT
						</h6>

						<p>
							We will be using a <span style="font-weight:bold;">new format</span> that ensures more action for everyone! 
							All games will be played to <span style="font-weight:bold;">3 sets of 21 points</span> (2 points clear), regardless whether a team has already won the first two sets or not. Each set will count for 1 league point, meaning that a team could earn 1, 2 or 3 league points towards their final ranking from every game played.
						</p>

						<h6 style="font-weight:bold;">
							Refereeing:
						</h6>

						<p>
							The games will be refereed by other teams from the previous or following games. Otherwise, if both of the playing teams agree before their game, they will be allowed to self-referee, calling their own faults. We hope that this will develop and promote a spirit of fair play and create a healthier competitive environment.
						</p>


						<h6 style="font-size:16px;font-weight:bold;">
							Schedule:
						</h6>
						<p>
							A schedule will be sent to all teams before the start of their monthly league and teams must then ensure that they attend at the right times each Wednesday.
						</p>

						<p>
							A typical schedule will be:<br>
							1st Wednesday: 2 games per team<br>
							2nd Wednesday: 2 games per team<br>
							3rd Wednesday: 2 games per team<br>
							4th Wednesday: 1 game per team + 1 playoff game
						</p>
