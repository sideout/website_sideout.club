						<p>
							Introducing Side-it-Out, a new exciting format which brings together our popular <span
								style="font-weight:bold;">All-You-Can-Play</span> with the ultra-fast paced <span
								style="font-weight:bold;">King of the Court</span> competition format!
						</p>

						<p>
							<!--Unable to go back to indoor volleyball? Want to keep playing beach volleyball in the winter months?-->
							Want to get lots of court time with lots of different opponents? Want to compete but prefer
							to avoid
							committing to advance tournament registration?
							Worried about getting cold between matches? <span
								style="font-weight:bold;">Side-it-Out</span> has you fully covered!
						</p>

						<p>
							Side-it-Out will run throughout the season, <span style="font-weight:bold;">every Wednesday
								evening from 18:30 to 20:30
								at Leyton Beach.</span>
						</p>

						<p>
							Here's how it works:
						</p>

						<p>
							- 1: <span style="font-weight:bold;">Find a partner!</span> We recommend coming with a
							playing partner. If you don’t have one, let us know and we will do our best to link you up
							with someone in advance or on the day. You can change partners from week to week, but you
							will play all your games with the same partner on each day.
						</p>

						<p>
							- 2: <span style="font-weight:bold;">Turn up from 18:30</span> to sign up on the spot, pay
							your entry fees and start warming up.
						</p>

						<p>
							- 3: <span style="font-weight:bold;">Entry fees</span> are £12 per person or just £6 if you
							have a valid
							<span class="color_13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a style="color:#351ef7;"
									href="../membership.html" target="_self">SideOut
									Beach Volleyball
									Club Membership.</a>
							</span>
						</p>

						<!--<p>
							A <span style="font-weight:bold;">monthly discount package</span> is also available for £35
							and it gives you access to all Tuesday SIDE-it-OUT sessions and all Saturday
							All-You-Can-Play sessions each month!
						</p>-->

						<p>
							- 4: <span style="font-weight:bold;">Games start at 19:00</span>. You will get at least 3
							rounds of non-stop play ending at around 20:30. All levels are welcome and all players will
							be accommodated!
						</p>

						<p>
							- 5: <span style="font-weight:bold;">Collect ranking points and win great prizes!</span> You
							and your partner will win Side-it-Out ranking points for every round you play on each day
							and there will be some cool goodies up for grabs for the top ranked players and teams at the
							end of each month!
						</p>

						<h2><span style="font-weight:bold;">So, what exactly is King of the Court?</span></h2>

						<p>
							An exciting, fast and furious-paced tournament format taking the beach volleyball world by
							storm!
						</p>

						<p>
							You probably saw some of the great videos from the King of the Court event in Utrecht in
							September 2020, the first international beach volleyball tournament after the global
							pandemic, complete with an awesome new stadium with private skyboxes!
						</p>

						<p>
							The format sees up to 5 teams play against each other on a single court, until one men's
							team is crowned King of the Court and one women’s team is crowned Queen of the Court.
						</p>

						<p>
							If you have ever played the classic "king of the court" or "queen of the court" in training,
							you will know how this works. In short, the objective is to get to the "king" or "queen"
							side of the court and stay there for as long as possible by siding out and accumulating
							points! After each rally, the losing team leaves the court, with the winning team moving to,
							or staying on, the "king" or "queen" side.
						</p>

								target="_self">www.kingofthecourt.com/game</a> for more info on how it works.
						</p>

						<p>
							See you on the sand!
