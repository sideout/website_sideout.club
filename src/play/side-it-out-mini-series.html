            </p>

            <ul>

                  </span> to get priority on the day. Members and non-members can also just turn up and sign up on the day.
                </p>
              </li>

                  </span>.
                </p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>
                  4: Games start at 11:00am. You will get several rounds of non-stop play ending at around 4:00pm. All levels are welcome and all players will be accommodated!
                </p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>
                  5: Collect ranking points and win great prizes! You will win ranking points for every day you play and there will be some cool goodies up for grabs for the top ranked players at the end of each day and again at the end of the series!
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              So, how exactly does this work? 
            </p>

            <p>
              The Side-it-Out Mini-Series sees up to 8 players play with and against each other on a single court and collect points every time they win a rally by siding out. 
            </p>

            <p>
              If you have ever played the classic "king of the court" or "queen of the court" in training, you will know how this works. In short, the objective is to get to the "king" or "queen" side of the court and stay there for as long as possible by siding out and accumulating points! 
            </p>

            <p>
              There’s a twist though! For this version you gain points as an individual instead of as a team.  After each rally, the player that made the error leaves the court, with the remaining players rotating towards, or staying on, the "king" or "queen" side. This way, you will change partners frequently and get to play lots of beach volleyball with and against many different players!
            </p>

            <p>
              <span>See you on the sand!</span>
            </p>
