              Prefer to play non-stop over fewer hours with fewer breaks between games? 
              Or maybe you just want the option to turn up and play without the commitment of pre-registering in advance? 
              Either way, our <span style="font-weight:bold;">Wednesday Night Socials</span> have got you covered!
            </p>

            <section id="Side-it-Out"></section>
            <div
              style="background-color:#bda6a626;padding-left: 15px;padding-right: 15px;padding-top: 15px;padding-bottom: 15px;">

              </p>

              <p>
                Would you like plenty of court time with many different opponents? Want to compete but prefer to avoid committing to advance 
                tournament registration? Worried about getting cold between matches? Read on because we've got you fully covered!
              </p>
              <p>
                Side-it-Out offers players non-stop game-play by bringing together our popular <span style="font-weight:bold;">All-You-Can-Play</span> 
                with the ultra-fast paced <span style="font-weight:bold;">King of the Court</span> competition format!
              </p>

              <p>
                Here's how it works:
              </p>


              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    <span style="font-weight:bold;">Find a partner!</span> We recommend coming with a playing partner. If you don’t have one, let us know and we will do our best to link you up with someone in advance or on the day. You can change partners from week to week, but you will play all your games with the same partner on each day.
                  </p>
                </li>
  
                
  
                <li>
                  <p>
                    <span style="font-weight:bold;">Turn up from 18:30</span> to sign up on the spot, pay your entry fees and start warming up.
                  </p>
                </li>
  
  
                <li>
                  <p>
                    <span style="font-weight:bold;">Games start at 19:00.</span> You will get at least 3 rounds of non-stop play ending at around 20:30. All levels are welcome and all players will be accommodated!
                  </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>
                    <span style="font-weight:bold;">Collect ranking points and win great prizes!</span> You and your partner will win Side-it-Out ranking points for every round you play on each day and there will be some cool goodies up for grabs for the top ranked players and teams at the end of each month!
                  </p>
                </li>
  
              </ul>
  
              <p>
                So, what exactly is King of the Court?
              </p>

              <p>
                An exciting, fast and furious-paced tournament format taking the beach volleyball world by storm!
              </p>

              <p>
                The format sees up to 5 teams play against each other on a single court, until one men's team is crowned King of the Court and one women’s team is crowned Queen of the Court.
              </p>

              <p>
                If you have ever played the classic "king of the court" or "queen of the court" in training, you will know how this works. In short, the objective is to get to the "king" or "queen" side of the court and stay there for as long as possible by siding out and accumulating points! After each rally, the losing team leaves the court, with the winning team moving to, or staying on, the "king" or "queen" side.
              </p>
